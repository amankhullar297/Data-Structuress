Problem : In Binary Tree, Inorder successor of a node is the next node in Inorder traversal of the Binary Tree.
Inorder Successor is NULL for the last node in Inorder traversal.
In Binary Search Tree, Inorder Successor of an input node can also be defined as the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the input node.
, it is sometimes important to find next node in sorted order.

Input :                     20
                           /  \
                          8    22
                         / \
                        4   12
                           /  \
                          10   14

output : Inorder successor of 8 is 10, inorder successor of 10 is 12 and inorder successor of 14 is 20.

Approach : Solution is divided in two cases :
           1. If node whose successor we needs to find has right sub-tree, then we can drill down to the leftmost
              element of it's right node. And the last left-most node is successor.
           2. If node does not have right-subtree then successor is one of the ancestor of the node.
