Problem : The car manufacturer Honda holds their distribution system in the form of a tree (not necessarily binary).
 The root is the company itself, and every node in the tree represents a car distributor that receives cars
 from the parent node and ships them to its children nodes.
 The leaf nodes are car dealerships that sell cars direct to consumers.
 In addition, every node holds an integer that is the cost of shipping a car to it.

 A path from Hondaâ€™s factory to a car dealership, which is a path from the root to a leaf in the tree, is called a Sales Path.
 The cost of a Sales Path is the sum of the costs for every node in the path.

                      1

Output : 7

Explanation: Output is 7 because it's the minimum Sales Path cost. There are two sales path in the tree whose Sales
path is 7.
1. 0 -> 6 -> 1
2. 0 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1

Approach : Calculate sum of the sales cost of each path i.e from company to the last distributor and calculates min of
all the sales path.
